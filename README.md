# Clicky Game

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create a simple game using React where a user will click on a picture then the pictures will shuffle. each unique picture click will award a point, however clicking on a picture that has already been clicked on will results in a game over. The high score for that session will be saved and displayed.

## Usage
Just load the page and start clicking, just remember what pictures you have clicked on!
